#  Analyzing Clinical Research and Biotech Investment Patterns (2019–2024)

## Overview

This project examines how funding and clinical trial activity evolved across various therapeutic areas between **2019 and 2024**, focusing on **biotech-backed research**. Using **SQL** to process and analyze synthetic datasets, it explores variations in trial frequency and funding allocation across sponsor types, disease conditions, and trial phases.

While the initial focus was biotech-specific, the analysis revealed broader insights into global clinical research trends. **Academic institutions** conducted the highest number of trials, followed by **startups** and **biotech companies**. Within biotech, the greatest funding concentration was seen in **Alzheimer’s research**, exceeding **$56 million** across **7 trials**. Other prominent areas included **Obesity**, **Lung Cancer**, and **Diabetes**.

This project demonstrates the power of **data-driven analysis** in uncovering R&D priorities within the clinical landscape and highlights skills in **SQL querying**, **relational data exploration**, and **data storytelling** through **Excel dashboards**.

##  Research Questions

- Which therapeutic conditions recorded the most clinical trials between 2019–2024?  
- How does trial activity differ across sponsor types — **Biotech**, **Academic**, **Pharma**, and **Startup**?  
- Is there a correlation between biotech funding and clinical trial volume?

---

##  Major Findings

- **Alzheimer’s disease** was the most heavily funded area among biotech sponsors, attracting **$56M** across **7 trials**.  
- **Academic organizations** led in overall trial count, conducting **43 studies** during the 5-year period.  
- **Biotech firms** were most active in **Alzheimer’s** and **Lung Cancer** research.  
- **Phase III trials** were the most common across all sponsor types, reflecting strong late-stage development pipelines.  
- Despite the biotech emphasis, **academic sponsors** significantly influenced overall research directions.
